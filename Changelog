Changelog:

V0.6 July &, 2015

	* Moved all the pre-processor code to the printer library
	* Added a CLI
	* Added a validation pre-processor stage that removed M82, M82, and T commands

V0.5 July 7, 2015

	* Finished all the G-code pre-processor stages. So now it has preparation, wave bonding, thermal bonding, bed compensation, backlash, and feed rate stages that can be preformed on a provided G-code file. Right not it just defaults to applying all of them except the wave bonding stage, but I'll make a CLI soon to allow better configurations at run time.
	* It obtains more information about the print before preforming the pre-processor stages now. So it determines the maximums and minimums of the model dimensions and extruder movements. The extruder movements are used to check if the model will go out of bounds.

V0.4 July 5, 2015

	* Changed how firmware files work. So no they need to be named with their version number, Ex: 2015062401.rom, and they don't need to be modified at all so ignore the whole formatting for the header introduced in V0.3. Right now it looks for a file named 2015062401.rom, but it'll later be changed so you can provide a file name as a parameter.
	* Implemented decrypting and encrypting firmware rom, it it'll decrypt the provided rom and generate a CRC32 from that which is used to verify that updating was successful
	* Got preparation, thermal bonding, and feed rate conversion G-code pre-processors all done
	* Added boundary checking for when the model is analyzed to prevent printing outside of what the printer is capable of

V0.3 July 3, 2015

	* Moved printer to its own class
	* Added firmware verification
	* Added fan type and extruder current EEPROM updating
	* Added firmware updating. Firmware files need to be in the following format:
		Bytes 1 - 3: M3D
		Byte 4: 0x1A
		Bytes 5 - 8: Firmware version in big endian. Ex: 2015062401 would be 0x78 0x1B 0x69 0x81
		Bytes 9 - 12: Firmware CRC in big endian. Ex: 459338129 would be 0x1B 0x60 0xF1 0x91
		Bytes 13 - EOF: The firmware data
	* Currently the rom has to be named test.rom and be in the same directory as the program for it to be used

V0.2 July 1, 2015

	* Implemented udev rule to map printer to /dev/micro_m3d, to change permission of printer to not require root, and avoid problems with Modem Manager
	* Simplified connecting to the printer
	* Moved G-code parser to its own class
	* Started implementing G-code pre-processor
	
V0.1 June 26, 2015

	* Initial release
