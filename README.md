# M3D_Linux
A Linux program that can communicate with the Micro M3D printer
#
If this program is run without any parameters, then it will enter a mode that allows for individual G-code commands to be entered and ran.

If a G-code file is provided as a parameter when running this program, then the program will process that file then send each command to the printer.

TODO:
* Work more on preprocess
* Maybe create a GUI
